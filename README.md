# telco-customer-churn
Project Objective

With a subscription-based business model, customer retention is one of the key performance indicators for a telecommunication company. Competition is tough in the industry as customers can choose from a variety of providers. 
Hence, one unhappy experience may give rise to a customer moving to the competitor, resulting in churn. Due to the telco market becoming increasingly saturated, there should be a greater focus on preventing customer churn, as the cost of attracting new subscribers is substantially higher than retaining existing customers. There are two approaches to manage customer churn which consist of reactive and proactive. Therefore, instead of reacting after being abandoned, the objective of the company is to detect in advance, what is the reason for churn  This will enable the company to enact appropriate and effective marketing strategies to proactively engage with these customers, noting that different customers may behave differently and have different preferences. By doing this, it is more likely to maximise the likelihood of retaining those customers.

Business problem:

To meet the objective above, it is important to understand and more importantly, be able to model, the factors that are going to have an impact on the churn? For instance:

How do different contract types impact the churn?

Does the gender of the customer affect the churn rate?

Do senior citizens have more or less likelihood of churn?

Do customers with dependents (family) have more or less likelihood to churn?

Are there any service offerings which the company needs to pay more attention to?

Is there any relationship between churn and monthly charges?

Is a longer term customer more loyal, or more likely to churn than a new customer?

Is there any relationship between method of payment and churn?

The scope of this project is to find the relationships between the available input attributes and whether the customer churned
